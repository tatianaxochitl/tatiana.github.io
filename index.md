##About Me
Hello, my name is Tatiana (ta-tee-ah-na or tat-yah-nah), but I go by **Tati**(tah-tee). I am a first year graduate student in the Big Data Analytics program. I graduated in 2019 with a BS in Computer Science from SDSU. I also work as a web developer for the College of Health and Human Services here at SDSU. 
I am in the BDA program here at SDSU because I have an interest in NLP, Machine Learning, and Machine Translation. I hope that the concepts I learn from the BDA program will help me further understand my interests and advance in the field.
